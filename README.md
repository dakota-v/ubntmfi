Ubiquiti mFi Controller
=======================

This repo contains an alternative web controller for the Ubiquiti mFi mPower
strips. Who knows what could happen here. My initial goal is to provide a
simple mobile site to control the switches.

Installation
============
Run ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` from within a virtualenv then start
with ``python server.py``
