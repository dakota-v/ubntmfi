Ubiquiti Inform Protocol
========================

These are just some unstructured notes about the inform protocol at this point.

Packet Structure
----------------
4 bytes          magic number            integer
4 bytes          version                 integer
6 bytes          hwaddr                  string
2 bytes          flags                   short
16 bytes         initialization vector   string
4 bytes          data version            integer
4 bytes          data length             integer
n bytes          encrypted payload       string


magic must == 1414414933
data version must < 1
flags & 0x1 != 0 means encrypted
flags & 0x2 != 0 means compressed


The payload is AES encrypted in CBC mode using PKCS5 padding. They key is the
device auth key from the database or a master key that is hard coded if the
device hasn't been provisioned yet. The master key is hard coded in the
controller code in the DeviceManager class and pretty easy to find.


MASTER_KEY = "ba86f2bbe107c7c57eb5f2690775c712"
